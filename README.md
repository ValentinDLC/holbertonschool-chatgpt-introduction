## 📝 Description
**Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT**

This project introduces students to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically **ChatGPT**, into the software development workflow. The module emphasizes two essential aspects of programming:  

1. **Debugging** — Leveraging ChatGPT to identify and fix coding errors across multiple programming languages.  
2. **Automation** — Using ChatGPT to generate repetitive code structures, documentation, and simple tests, thereby increasing efficiency and productivity.  

By the end of this project, you will be able to use AI as a powerful assistant in your coding process.

## 🎯 Objectives

### 🔹 Debugging
- Diagnose and resolve errors in existing code.  
- Understand typical programming pitfalls across different environments.  
- Use ChatGPT as a tool for problem-solving and troubleshooting.  

### 🔹 Automation
- Automate repetitive tasks (boilerplate code, documentation, unit tests).  
- Reduce manual work and focus on problem-solving and creativity.  

---

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- **Enhanced Debugging Skills**: Ability to clearly identify, explain, and fix bugs.  
- **Automation Proficiency**: Competence in automating coding tasks with AI.  
- **AI Integration Mindset**: Preparedness for future AI-driven development workflows.  

⚠️ *Remember: Always test, verify, and critically evaluate ChatGPT’s output. Never rely blindly on generated code.*

## 📋 Tasks

### ✅ 0. Debugging - Python Factorial  
- Fix infinite loop in factorial calculation.  
- Input: `./factorial.py 5` → Output: `120`.  

### ✅ 1. Debugging - Python Arguments  
- Print only program arguments (excluding the filename).  
- Input: `./print_arguments.py 1 2 3` → Output:

### ✅ 2. Debugging - HTML / JavaScript  
- Correct typo in button ID.  
- Clicking button changes background color randomly.  

### ✅ 3. Debugging - Python Mines  
- Implement win condition: detect when all non-mine cells are revealed.  

### ✅ 4. Documentation - Python Factorial  
- Add docstrings with **function description**, **parameters**, and **returns**.  

### ✅ 5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook  
- Add robust error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).  

### ✅ 6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python  
- Fix gameplay errors and input handling.  
- Detect valid winner and prevent invalid moves.
